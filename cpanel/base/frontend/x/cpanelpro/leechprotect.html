Leech Protect allows you to prevent your users from giving out or publicly posting their password to 
a restricted area of your site.   This feature will redirect (and suspend if selected) accounts
which have been compromised to a url of your choice.

<br><br>
Please select the folder you wish to protect by clicking on its name.  You can navigate by clicking on icons.
